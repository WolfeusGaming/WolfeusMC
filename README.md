**THIS REPLIT USES [PluginInstaller](https://github.com/darverdevs/PluginInstaller)**

**LATEST UPDATE: NOW FORWARDS IPS!!**

**ALSO, IF IT DOESNT WORK, ANOTHER FIX IS TO RENAME THE REPLIT AND THEN RENAME IT BACK**

## Helpful video tutorial by a generous user
motd changing is DIFFERENT than what these tutorials say!! -- check the `java/bungee_command/config.yml` for how to change (motd1 is first line, motd2 (you can add this) is the 2nd one)

## [Helpful Google Doc by a generous user](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MdaQRQbRXb9wXRtdS-c7OGBMcTh9DO8iAKT6fcpdJ5g/edit)
Here in case it helps!

## Usage:
Fork it, and press "Run" at the top to run the server!

##

### NOTE: to control, you MUST open the website view in a new tab instead of playing in the editor.

## To change the server icon:
Replace the `server-icon.png` file under `java/bungee_command` with your desired server icon.

## To run server commands:
In the "Console" tab in the replit, you can send server commands.

## To save progress:
**Notice: This is now done automatically, every 5 minutes, using a plugin!** In the server console or in-game as an opped player, run `/save-all` to save the world.

## Too slow?
This is because you are using a free service to host a Minecraft server. Of course it is slow and the only way to fix this is to self-host at home.

## Getting admin/OP or enabling command blocks
To give yourself OP (admin), go to the server console and run `op username` and press enter (replacing "username" with your username in-game).

To enable command blocks, go to `java/bukkit_command/server.properties` and add a new line at the end: `enable-command-block=true`. Then, restart the server.

## Plugins
Eaglercraft is Minecraft 1.5.2, so plugins you will use will have to be supported by Bukkit 1.5.2 (not Spigot). You can add plugin JAR files into the `java/bukkit_command/plugins` folder.

**Official Plugin Collection**

https://github.com/LAX1DUDE/eaglercraft-plugins

**Some plugins I suggest you use:**

### [LoginSecurity](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/loginsecurity/files/711129)
Adds /login and /register to your server. **Make sure you turn OFF sessions in the config (run server once after adding plugin, run the server once after adding loginsecurity, go to "plugins/LoginSecurity/config.yml", and change `sessions: use:` from true to false), or else players may be able to "resume session" on any account!**
### [Essentials](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/essentials/files/711777) & [Essentials Extra](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/essentials/files/711776)
"Essential" commands and features for any Minecraft server. Widely popular, even today!
### [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit/files/698941)
Super popular world editing plugin!
### [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard/files/706558)
Region protecting. Requires WorldEdit for selecting the regions.
### [PlotMe](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plotme/files/707659)
A once-popular plot plugin for creative OR survival plots to build on!
### [SeekAndFind](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/seekandfind/files/699522)
A cool-looking hide-and-seek plugin, BUT I have not tested it so it might not work!
### [NoSpawnChunks](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/nospawnchunks/files/586974)
Prevents loading spawn chunks on your server. Helps to optimize it greatly!

## Not working?
1. Make sure you haven't broken any essential files.
2. **(try this multiple times, at least 5-10. this fixes the "End of Stream" issue among many, many others)** Try clicking on the "Shell" tab (next to the "Console" tab) and running `busybox reboot`. Then you can try pressing the Run button again and see if it works.
3. Join the [official Eaglercraft discord server](https://discord.gg/6yTNkypXWh) and look for any answers there.
4. If all else fails, contact me directly **through Discord** at `ayunami2000#5250`
5. If you do not have access to Discord, THEN you can leave a comment on the Replit.
